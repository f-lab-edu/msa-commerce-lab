### Gradle Multi-Module Optimization
```kotlin
// Root build.gradle.kts optimization
allprojects {
    // Parallel builds
    gradle.startParameter.isParallelProjectExecutionEnabled = true
    
    // Build cache
    buildCache {
        local {
            isEnabled = true
        }
    }
}

// Custom plugin for common configurations
plugins {
    id("com.msa.commerce.java-library-plugin")
}
```

WORKDIR /app
COPY gradlew build.gradle.kts ./
COPY gradle ./gradle
RUN ./gradlew dependencies --no-daemon

COPY . .
RUN ./gradlew bootJar --no-daemon

FROM openjdk:21-jre-slim
COPY --from=builder /app/build/libs/*.jar app.jar
EXPOSE 8080
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=60s \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:8080/actuator/health || exit 1
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app.jar"]
```
